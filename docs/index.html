<h1>Outer Product as an Introduction to APL and a Pretty Cool Thing in General</h1>
<p>
My workshop at LambdaConf 2019. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlUHw4hC4OY">Video</a> (2 hr 25 min).
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/OuterProduct">main repository</a> contains these slides as well as other materials including Dyalog APL code for you to run on your own.
</p>
<p>
Start at the <a href="NTT.html">first slide</a>, or see <a href="allslides.html">all slides</a> on one page.
When viewing a slide navigate with the arrow keys or their equivalents wasd: left and right to move to adjacent slides, down to advance animation, and up to reset animation.
You can also advance animation by clicking anywhere inside a slide.
Skip entire sections using , and . or q and e.
</p>
<p>
There is also a page with <a href="commentary.html">commentary</a> on the slides, which I recommend reading alongside the talk or after viewing it.
</p>
<p>
Slides are designed for 1920x1080 resolution, and the DejaVu font family.
